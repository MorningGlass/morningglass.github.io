# morningglass.github.io

A GitHub Pages site to host data from Hill List for a group of friends. The maps are generated via dataspell and Folium locally from manually updated data files.

### Individual Maps
These show data for individuals - green symbols indicate climbed Munros, blue are still to be climbed.

### Overlap Maps
Manually generated maps for 2 and 3 person groups showing hills all members in each group still have to do.
